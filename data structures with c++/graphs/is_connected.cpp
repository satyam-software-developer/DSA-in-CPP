/* Problem statement
Given an undirected graph G(V,E), check if the graph G is connected graph or not.

Note:

1. V is the number of vertices present in graph G and vertices are numbered from 0 to V-1. 
2. E is the number of edges present in graph G.
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Input Format :
The first line of input contains two integers, that denote the value of V and E.
Each of the following E lines contains two integers, that denote that there exists an edge between vertex a and b.
Output Format :
The first and only line of output contains "true" if the given graph is connected or "false", otherwise.
Constraints :
0 <= V <= 1000
0 <= E <= (V * (V - 1)) / 2
0 <= a <= V - 1
0 <= b <= V - 1
Time Limit: 1 second
Sample Input 1:
4 4
0 1
0 3
1 2
2 3
Sample Output 1:
true
Sample Input 2:
4 3
0 1
1 3 
0 3
Sample Output 2:
false 
Sample Output 2 Explanation
The graph is not connected, even though vertices 0,1 and 3 are connected to each other but there isnâ€™t any path from vertices 0,1,3 to vertex 2.  */
